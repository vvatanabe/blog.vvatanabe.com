      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi. I&amp;rsquo;m Yuichi Watanabe. Please call me Nabe.  But why is my last name ends with &amp;ldquo;nabe?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work is a Software Engineer. There are many foreigners in our company. For example, Taiwanese, Indonesians, Swiss, Germans, Americans, Canadians and so on. Lucky to have such great members. I enjoyed developing a products with my colleagues. I need to use English at work. We usually use English and Japanese languages in communicating with each other in our workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have a problem.  I&amp;rsquo;m not good in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can do a little reading and writing using English. However, particularly speaking and listening are my weak points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve started writing a blog in English!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contents are quite different from other blogs. Usually my topics are technology, work, Japanese sake, sumo wrestling, music, daily life activities and so on. If I make mistakes in my English, please pardon me. If you are an engineer, would you give me a pull request on Github please? I would like to communicate enjoyably with my colleagues using English as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Knowing about cultures in various countries will enrich our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
