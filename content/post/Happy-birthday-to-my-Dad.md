We celebrated his birthday today. It’s the moment we’ve all been waiting for. We enjoyed small talks while eating Chinese dishes. We also drank a Chinese liquor named “Shao xing jiu” which tasted best with cube sugar in it.

He was very pleased when he saw the digital camera I gave him. My younger sister and her husband gave him a ticket. It was a trip to Kumamoto. He was very happy with all the birthday presents he received.

I hope my father will be able to capture happy moments using his digital camera especially when he travels.

I would like to thank everyone for celebrating this special event with us. I hope you all had a great time today.

To my father, I would like to say thank you for being such a great father to me and my sister. Thank you for all the sacrifices you have done for us. Thank you for showing so much love for our mother. Lastly, thank you for loving my wife as your own child as well. I hope you enjoyed your party and I wish you have more birthdays to come.
