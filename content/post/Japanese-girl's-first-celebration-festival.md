That party is Japanese girl's first celebration festival called "Hinamatsuri" also known as "momonosekku".
Hinamatsuri is an annual event to wish for girl's healthy growth in Japan. This is one of the famous Japanese traditional culture.

The dolls in the picture below is called "hina dolls". We display that dolls and peach blossoms, rice cake cubes and so on, on the steps.

Some people believe that doll can take a girl's bad fortune. So the tradition displaying hina dolls still exists.ã€€We also believe that you have better not use your ancestor's hina dolls to pray for a girl's fortune. It's said that it's better to have your own hina dolls.

We enjoyed many dishes and alcohol at the party. So I may have drunk too much. But there is memory, so it's okay!

Hey sae-chan! We are praying for your happiness.

Thanks!
