My father turned 70 years old on Valentines Day because his birthday was February 14. I am planning to hold a birthday party for him this Sunday. The venue will be at a Chinese Restaurant located in Tenzin. The food in that restaurant is very delicious.
My wife and I have been there 3 months ago. I thought that the food and the service were really good and I was impressed. I reserved a private room.  The number of attendees allowed in that room is 7 including me. My parents, younger sister, brother in law, niece and my wife will be there. I will give a digital camera as a surprise gift for my father.
That camera can be used easily even by older. Because the screen is large and there are few buttons and functions. Itâ€™s very simple. And My child will be born in April so I would like my father to take pictures of my child. I am looking forward to that day.

Thanks.
